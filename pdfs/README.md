Because I write my blog posts in org mode (with the help of [org2jekyll](https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll)) I can easily
also create pdfs of each of my blog posts (you can see the command I use for that [here](https://github.com/b-t-g/dotfiles/blob/dda2d794800123e7fd62a233831e275027225fde/emacs#L203)),
so I decided that it would be neat to have the pdfs of each of my blog posts in the same repository.

TeX is rendered on my blog using MathJax, but rendered in the pdf using pdflatex, so there my be some differences between the blog post and the corresponding pdf (the one
for natural transformations is different, for example), but the blog post is the first-class construct.
