<p>
I've learned a lot of things the hard way in the few years that I've been working. Some obvious in retrospect, others more subtle. Here, I'll just outline my biggest
mistakes, why I think they were mistakes, and how I fixed them.

<p>
I used to be god awful at these. I would give this dry, pseudo-biographical statement about my educational and professional background. That's dumb and no one wants to hear that. Instead,
tell a story about your interest as a programmer, what do you like about it, what do you value that other candidates might not? In my case, I now talk
about my interest in debuggable systems and documentation. No need to give an autobiographical speech, just talk about what you find important and how you got there.

<li><a id="orga289e31"></a>Drill fundamental data structures over fancy algorithms<br />
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orga289e31">
<p>
In my case, knowing even somewhat fancy algorithms like Floyd-Warshal's all-pairs shortest path ended up being a detriment to me in interviews.
Instead, knowing the fundamental data structures and where they fit best has been much more useful. Some problems seem completely impenetrable
until you realize that a heap is the correct data structure. In short, know your basic data structures, your basic algorithms, how they fit together,
and you'll be golden on algorithm interviews as a new hire to mid-level engineer at the very least.

<li><a id="org95624f0"></a>Ask questions and think out loud more<br />
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org95624f0">
<p>
Especially when struggling to find an approach, saying what I was thinking and asking questions became more useful over time. Sometimes interviewers are genuinely
uninterested and just want to ask you trivia and don't want to respond to your statements and questions, but that's also good to know because you now know you
don't want to work there!

<li><a id="org3d4eb45"></a>Conduct interviews as an interviewer when you get the chance<br />
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org3d4eb45">
<p>
The biggest thing for my confidence during interviews was conducting many interviews as an interviewer. By sitting on the other side of the table, I was able to
relax substantially. Interviews stopped being a life-or-death situation and just became another day in the office. After that, I was able to relax a lot more
when I was the interviewee.

<h3 id="org2090aed">Don't worry about open source contributions and side projects</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org2090aed">
<p>
I used to worry about finding open source projects to contribute to and it ended up causing undue stress. I ended up making some contributions and starting
some side projects and nobody cared. It was fun but ultimately useless as a career-advancing move. If you find them fun or you have an idea for some side project
or feature for an existing open source project, go for it, but don't stress out about them. Maybe these kinds of things are more valued in the Bay Area
(I started my career in New York City), but no one about them at all it in my experience.

<h3 id="org3093fa0">Understand what managers and tech leads (are supposed to) do</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org3093fa0">
<p>
Fundamentally, managers are responsible for making their teams more efficient and should be empowered to do so. This one took me an embarrassingly long time to understand. I now have an exceedingly
good manager who both exercises this practice and hammers home that this is what she's doing. Tech leads should be similar, just at a more technical level: "How does this part of the code base work,"
"I'm trying to decide how to implement this feature", etc.,

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgee47e69">
<p>
Sometimes managers are institutionally unempowered and at best can only act as a shield from the more unsavory parts of the organizations, sometimes managers don't care,
or sometimes they just don't know how to make teams more efficient. It's important to recognize situations when this isn't the case and act accordingly.

<h3 id="org6f28bc9">Embrace your unique skills instead of trying to emulate coworkers</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org6f28bc9">
<p>
This goes along nicely with my previous post "Programming for mathematicians*". I'd see people that were successful in the company and try to emulate whatever they did.
The problem with that is, I didn't necessarily know precisely how they worked, how they got there, or anything else. As a result, I ended up imitating whatever it
is they did poorly. Instead, I should have embraced my own strengths and become successful within the company my own way.

<li><a id="orgd2d76b7"></a>Fully understand what work you're doing<br />
<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgd2d76b7">
<p>
In particular, in trying to emulate my coworkers, it was tempting to try to get work done as fast as my coworkers early on in my career.
However, this ended up being very limiting and making my job less enjoyable. If you have trouble with this, ask your tech lead or manager for guidance!
</p>

<p>
Taking time to fully understand what my code is doing on a level deeper than a superficial level is valuable for many reasons (in roughly ascending order of importance):

<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org51a34b3">

Each unit of work becomes an opportunity a learn how the overall system works. I find learning things fun, so this is a big win.

<li><a id="org8688f62"></a>It makes you more efficient in the long run.<br />
<div class="outline-text-5" id="text-org8688f62">
<p>
You gain a deeper understanding in the code base which in turn gives you more context about how to make new changes faster.

<p>
You'll make fewer stupid mistakes that you'll need to fix in code review and burn at least one code review cycle; possibly even more if you
don't fully understand the code review comments, either.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-orgf16a3fa">
<p>
Reading a huge list of changes without entirely being sure how pieces precisely fit together is difficult. Instead, break up your PR where it makes sense into individual commits.
Even if you squash them together when you merge, it makes reviewing easier, which in turn gives you more helpful comments and you learn more. To better facilitate this,
I pretty much always run <code>git add -p</code> (or some equivalent depending on the editor that I use) to only get precisely the changes that make sense together in a single commit.
</p>

<p>
Also, if your PR ends up changing a lot, try to squash, rearrange, and sometimes delete commits so that it's still easy to review commit by commit. <code>git rebase</code> is an intimidating
but very useful command here.

<div class="outline-text-4" id="text-org1a1bb9a">
<p>
When I create a PR, I tend to add a comment in the PR itself the questions that I may have. It might be "I want to implement this, but I'm stuck," "Is this the best way to accomplish
the thing I want to do," "Is this idiomatic," etc.,
